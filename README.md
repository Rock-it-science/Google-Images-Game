Players select 3 images from the internet, then enter as many titles as they can, then each
  player must match an image to a title. (TKO but with Google image search)

Index page:
  Players enter a username and room code.
  First player to join receives a button that says "start game"
  Host page displays room code and players currently in the game.

Image selection page:
  Displays player name at the top of the page, and when the game starts, prompts
  players to enter an image URL. The page then displays a preview of the image.
  Once all players have submitted their image, or time has run out, all players
  are redirected to the titles page.

Titles page:
  All players enter as many titles as they can and they are all sent to a master list,
  then all players are redirected to the matching page.

Matching page
  Players are randomly given 3 images and 3 titles, and must match one of each.
  Players are then redirected to the waiting page while the Host page displays
  all of the hilarious player combinations.

Room system:
  Each room corresponds to a SQL table where the name of the table is the room code.
